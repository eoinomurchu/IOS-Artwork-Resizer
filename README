# IOS Artwork Resizer #
### by Lar Judge ###

This is a really simple Python script that resizes iOS icons to the appropriate size. All you have to do is make sure that there's a file called `iTunesArtwork.png` in the directory where it's run. I will get around to making this nicer, but I needed to bash it out in a hurry.

You are free to use this script however you please. If you make any improvements feel free to contribute them.
